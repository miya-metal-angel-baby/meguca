	$$$$ TOOLS $$$$

* BIN POST
Hides the post into a small trash bin icon that can be 
clicked on to view by anyone. Doesn't actually delete 
the post, for transparency reasons.

* SPOILER IMAGE
Forces the image to be spoilered. Use for 3D.

* DELETE IMAGE
Delete the image entirely. Only use for CP.

* VIEW BY IP
Opens popup that shows all posts made under the same IP. 
Only use when considering a ban.

* BAN
IP ban for X minutes. Use for short time and only when 
absolutely necessary.

* PURGE POST
Bins all posts by an IP. Use following a ban in the case 
of spam if necessary.

* NOTIFICATION
Displays a site-wide announcement at the top of the page.

	$$$$ POLICY $$$$

Always err on the side of caution when using any moderation.
It's best to have an invisible presence. Do not post with
mod trip unless directly relevant, as when answering a
question fielded to mods. Mod tools are all designed with
transparency in mind, with the intention of limiting mod
abuse. Rule with a light hand or you'll sour the culture.

	~~~~ BINNING ~~~~ 

Bin egregiously bad or cancerous posts as a light form of 
shaming. This is necessary until #sage is implemented,
then we can allow the community to perform its own 
cultural moderation. Use discretion.

	~~~~ 3D ~~~~ 

3D is soft banned - it applies to normieshit: twitter 
memes, 3DPD girls, etc. but not items relevant to
discussion (e.g. news) or non-normie animal memes. Use
discretion.

When normie 3D is posted with no text, bin the post. If the
text post is worthwhile enough to not justify binning the
whole thing, spoiler the image. If you're unsure if it falls
under normie 3D or not, spoiler the image.

	~~~~ CENSORED PICTURE ~~~~ 

If CP is posted, delete it, ban the poster for 1YR.

Gore, scat, etc. is OK as long as it's not being used
disruptively - e.g. being spammed or otherwise used to shit
on a discussion. In the case, spoiler the images, or if
they're without worthwhile text, bin the posts. If they
continue to be spammed, follow ban policy.

(Note: gorespam as community moderation being performed to
scare normies is OK.)

	~~~~ View by IP ~~~~ 

Viewing should be done very sparingly, because you don't 
want to undermine confidence in the anonymity between 
posts - samefagging is a right.

Viewing should be treated as a ban warning. Only view when
you're considering a ban, to evaluate whether they're
consistently disruptive and whether they're a regular or
outsider. Don't ever do it as a meme or to out a samefag,
and never reveal who's posts are who's when you do.

	~~~~ BANNING ~~~~ 

Bans should only be utilized when necessary. They should 
only be used on someone disrupting the board in bad faith 
- spamming, outsider disruption, shilling, etc.

Always do a view by IP before applying a ban to evaluate
whether they're a regular or outsider, by looking to see if
they have any normal contributive posts in their history
before they started acting disruptively.

Regulars should only receive a slap on the wrist: ban them
only for 1m for a quick warning, 10m or at most 30m when 
necessary. Ban for 1/2HR if they continue repeating the same
thing on the same day. If it's infrequent, even if it's the
same thing, still start back from 0. Their shitposting
is more important than your annoyance!

(Note: if it's a group of regulars all acting disruptively,
and not just one person, that's not necessarily disruptive,
since that's the current normal.)

Outsiders get more strict bans: 2HR by default. Usually
enough to deter them but still gives the possibility they
might decide to return and lurk in good faith. If they
return and continue shitting things up, ban for 12HR.

	$$$$ PRIVACY META $$$$

Some notes if anyone asks about the privacy of the site.

	~~~~ STANCE ~~~~

Privacy and mod transparency are primary concerns. 
Unfortunately, IP is the only functional way to ban due to
anonymity having no accounts. 

Bans are necessary due to the risk of CP, spambots, DDOS, 
etc. 

	~~~~ IP LOGGING ~~~~

IP is logged as minimally as possible:

* IP is logged when a post is made
* They are only stored for 7 days
* They are only logged for the purposes of issuing bans
* They are stored encrypted on the server
* They are not visible to any staff
* They are not shown even when View Posts by IP is performed
* There is a canary warning the Info section

VPN's and range bans are not utilized, if IP a concern,
using a VPN is recommended. TOR support is on the roadmap. 

Captcha-style verification may be turned on if spam becomes 
an issue. It's not google's ReCaptcha spyware; we have our 
own simple in-house solution for the sake of maintaining
privacy.

	~~~~ JAVASCRIPT ~~~~

Realtime implementation requires scripts. A no-script static 
posting fallback is on the roadmap, to provide functionality 
for hardened browsers, CLI, etc.

	~~~~ CANARY WARNING ~~~~

There is a canary warning on the info section.
